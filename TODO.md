# To do

- Consider changes here: https://github.com/llSourcell/Q-Learning-for-Trading/issues/2
- Create issues in repos pointing to this one
- Test example 5 and 6 with simulated prices
- Save all models
- Write a library for creating trades from positions and showing stats
- Don't use scaler in function for example 2 and 3
