# Deep Q Learning with 3 stocks

- `agent.py`: a Deep Q learning agent
- `envs.py`: a simple trading environment
- `model.py`: a multi-layer perceptron as the function approximator
- `utils.py`: some utility functions
- `requirement.txt`: all dependencies

## Run

Open the [Jupyter Notebook](deep-q-learning-agent-simulated-prices.ipynb)

## Dependencies

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Issues

- Why doesn't the model always win with repeating and predictable data?
