# 💰 Finance related machine learning examples

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FutureSharks/ml-finance/master/img/Tensorflow_logo.svg?sanitize=true" width="100">

Because I've seen many examples on Github that are either incomplete, unreliable, poorly documented or have errors.

All examples use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) so you can view the example on github with plots before cloning the repo. Jupyter Notebooks also make it easier to run and debug.

Pull requests and issues welcome.

## 📒 How to run

Open the the Jupyter Notebook from each example and follow the steps.

## 📈 Data

All data is included in the examples or is from [financial-data](https://github.com/FutureSharks/financial-data)
